# Reserve Management Queries üîí

Welcome to the Reserves section of our SQL Query Resource Center. This page contains datasets and queries for analyzing merchant reserve configurations and impact.

## Primary Datasets üìÅ

### `shopify-dw.money_products.shopify_payments_reserve_configurations_v1`

This is the primary recommended dataset for all reserve analysis. It combines data from Shopify Payments reserve configurations with their associated fixed and rolling reserves. It provides a unified view of all reserve types (fixed and rolling) that are mostly placed on merchant accounts via the Trust Platform.

#### Temporal Fields

| Field Name | Data Type | Comparison Function | Example |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | TIMESTAMP_SUB() | `WHERE created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)` |
| expires_at | TIMESTAMP | TIMESTAMP_SUB() | `WHERE expires_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)` |
| cancelled_at | TIMESTAMP | TIMESTAMP_SUB() | `WHERE cancelled_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)` |

## Common Queries üíª

### Current Reserve Configurations by Merchant

```sql
SELECT
  shop_id as merchant_id,
  rolling_reserve_percentage as reserve_rate,
  CASE
    WHEN fixed_reserve_status = 'active' AND rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Both'
    WHEN fixed_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Fixed'
    WHEN rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Rolling'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END as reserve_type,
  hold_duration as rolling_window_days,
  fixed_reserve_amount as minimum_reserve_amount_usd,
  created_at as effective_from_date,
  expires_at as effective_to_date,
  updated_at as last_updated_at
FROM
  `shopify-dw.money_products.shopify_payments_reserve_configurations_v1`
WHERE
  CURRENT_DATE() BETWEEN DATE(created_at) AND COALESCE(DATE(expires_at), DATE('9999-12-31'))
ORDER BY
  rolling_reserve_percentage DESC
```

### Reserve Configuration Changes Over Time

```sql
WITH reserve_changes AS (
  SELECT
    shop_id as merchant_id,
    created_at as effective_from_date,
    expires_at as effective_to_date,
    rolling_reserve_percentage as reserve_rate,
    CASE
      WHEN fixed_reserve_status = 'active' AND rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Both'
      WHEN fixed_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Fixed'
      WHEN rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Rolling'
      ELSE 'Unknown'
    END as reserve_type,
    LAG(rolling_reserve_percentage) OVER (PARTITION BY shop_id ORDER BY created_at) AS previous_reserve_rate,
    LAG(CASE
      WHEN fixed_reserve_status = 'active' AND rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Both'
      WHEN fixed_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Fixed'
      WHEN rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Rolling'
      ELSE 'Unknown'
    END) OVER (PARTITION BY shop_id ORDER BY created_at) AS previous_reserve_type
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.money_products.shopify_payments_reserve_configurations_v1`
)

SELECT
  merchant_id,
  effective_from_date,
  previous_reserve_rate,
  reserve_rate,
  reserve_rate - COALESCE(previous_reserve_rate, 0) AS reserve_rate_change,
  previous_reserve_type,
  reserve_type
FROM
  reserve_changes
WHERE
  reserve_rate != COALESCE(previous_reserve_rate, -1)
  OR reserve_type != COALESCE(previous_reserve_type, '')
ORDER BY
  effective_from_date DESC
```

### Reserve Rate Distribution Analysis

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN rolling_reserve_percentage = 0 THEN '0% (No Reserve)'
    WHEN rolling_reserve_percentage BETWEEN 0.01 AND 5 THEN '1-5%'
    WHEN rolling_reserve_percentage BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10%'
    WHEN rolling_reserve_percentage BETWEEN 11 AND 15 THEN '11-15%'
    WHEN rolling_reserve_percentage BETWEEN 16 AND 20 THEN '16-20%'
    WHEN rolling_reserve_percentage BETWEEN 21 AND 25 THEN '21-25%'
    ELSE '26% or higher'
  END AS reserve_rate_bucket,
  COUNT(*) AS merchant_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () * 100, 2) AS percentage
FROM
  `shopify-dw.money_products.shopify_payments_reserve_configurations_v1`
WHERE
  CURRENT_DATE() BETWEEN DATE(created_at) AND COALESCE(DATE(expires_at), DATE('9999-12-31'))
GROUP BY
  reserve_rate_bucket
ORDER BY
  MIN(rolling_reserve_percentage)
```

### Correlating Reserves with Risk Indicators

```sql
SELECT
  r.shop_id as merchant_id,
  r.rolling_reserve_percentage as reserve_rate,
  CASE
    WHEN r.fixed_reserve_status = 'active' AND r.rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Both'
    WHEN r.fixed_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Fixed'
    WHEN r.rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Rolling'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END as reserve_type,
  r.hold_duration as rolling_window_days,
  r.fixed_reserve_amount as minimum_reserve_amount_usd,
  r.created_at as effective_from_date,
  r.expires_at as effective_to_date
FROM
  `shopify-dw.money_products.shopify_payments_reserve_configurations_v1` r
WHERE
  CURRENT_DATE() BETWEEN DATE(r.created_at) AND COALESCE(DATE(r.expires_at), DATE('9999-12-31'))
ORDER BY
  r.rolling_reserve_percentage DESC
```

## Reserve Impact Analysis

```sql
WITH merchant_before_after AS (
  SELECT
    r.shop_id as merchant_id,
    r.created_at AS reserve_start_date,
    r.rolling_reserve_percentage as reserve_rate,
    CASE
      WHEN r.fixed_reserve_status = 'active' AND r.rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Both'
      WHEN r.fixed_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Fixed'
      WHEN r.rolling_reserve_status = 'active' THEN 'Rolling'
      ELSE 'Unknown'
    END as reserve_type,
    
    -- Pre-reserve metrics (30 days before) example
    -- Replace with actual metrics from available tables based on your needs
    0 AS avg_daily_gpv_before,
    
    -- Post-reserve metrics (30 days after) example
    -- Replace with actual metrics from available tables based on your needs
    0 AS avg_daily_gpv_after
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.money_products.shopify_payments_reserve_configurations_v1` r
  WHERE
    r.created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
    AND r.created_at < TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)  -- Ensure we have 30 days of post-data
    AND r.rolling_reserve_percentage > 0  -- Only include merchants with actual reserves
)

SELECT
  merchant_id,
  reserve_start_date,
  reserve_rate,
  reserve_type,
  avg_daily_gpv_before,
  avg_daily_gpv_after,
  avg_daily_gpv_after - avg_daily_gpv_before AS absolute_gpv_change,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(avg_daily_gpv_after - avg_daily_gpv_before, avg_daily_gpv_before) AS percent_gpv_change
FROM
  merchant_before_after
WHERE
  avg_daily_gpv_before > 0  -- Avoid division by zero
ORDER BY
  percent_gpv_change
```

## Notes and Best Practices üìù

- Always use `shopify-dw.money_products.shopify_payments_reserve_configurations_v1` as the primary source for reserve data
- Pay careful attention to TIMESTAMP fields and use appropriate comparison functions:
  - Use `DATE(created_at)` when comparing with DATE values like `CURRENT_DATE()`
  - Use `TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL X DAY)` when comparing with TIMESTAMP values
- When analyzing reserve impact, consider a sufficient time window before and after changes
- Account for seasonality when measuring reserve impact on processing volumes
- Correlate reserve changes with risk indicators to assess effectiveness
- Consider both the reserve rate and minimum amount when analyzing merchant impact
- When setting up new reserves, use historical data to model potential impact on merchant cash flow

Happy reserve analyzing! üîç

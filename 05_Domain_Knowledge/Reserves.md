# Reserve Management Queries üîí

Welcome to the Reserves section of our SQL Query Resource Center. This page contains datasets and queries for analyzing merchant reserve configurations and impact.

## Primary Datasets üìÅ

### `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__shopify_payments_reserve_configurations`

This is the primary recommended dataset for all reserve analysis. It contains comprehensive information about merchant reserve configurations, including rates, rolling windows, and effective dates.

## Common Queries üíª

### Current Reserve Configurations by Merchant

```sql
SELECT
  merchant_id,
  reserve_rate,
  reserve_type,
  rolling_window_days,
  minimum_reserve_amount_usd,
  effective_from_date,
  effective_to_date,
  last_updated_at
FROM
  `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__shopify_payments_reserve_configurations`
WHERE
  CURRENT_DATE() BETWEEN effective_from_date AND COALESCE(effective_to_date, '9999-12-31')
ORDER BY
  reserve_rate DESC
```

### Reserve Configuration Changes Over Time

```sql
WITH reserve_changes AS (
  SELECT
    merchant_id,
    effective_from_date,
    effective_to_date,
    reserve_rate,
    reserve_type,
    LAG(reserve_rate) OVER (PARTITION BY merchant_id ORDER BY effective_from_date) AS previous_reserve_rate,
    LAG(reserve_type) OVER (PARTITION BY merchant_id ORDER BY effective_from_date) AS previous_reserve_type
  FROM
    `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__shopify_payments_reserve_configurations`
)

SELECT
  merchant_id,
  effective_from_date,
  previous_reserve_rate,
  reserve_rate,
  reserve_rate - COALESCE(previous_reserve_rate, 0) AS reserve_rate_change,
  previous_reserve_type,
  reserve_type
FROM
  reserve_changes
WHERE
  reserve_rate != COALESCE(previous_reserve_rate, -1)
  OR reserve_type != COALESCE(previous_reserve_type, '')
ORDER BY
  effective_from_date DESC
```

### Reserve Rate Distribution Analysis

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN reserve_rate = 0 THEN '0% (No Reserve)'
    WHEN reserve_rate BETWEEN 0.01 AND 0.05 THEN '1-5%'
    WHEN reserve_rate BETWEEN 0.06 AND 0.10 THEN '6-10%'
    WHEN reserve_rate BETWEEN 0.11 AND 0.15 THEN '11-15%'
    WHEN reserve_rate BETWEEN 0.16 AND 0.20 THEN '16-20%'
    WHEN reserve_rate BETWEEN 0.21 AND 0.25 THEN '21-25%'
    ELSE '26% or higher'
  END AS reserve_rate_bucket,
  COUNT(*) AS merchant_count,
  COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS percentage
FROM
  `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__shopify_payments_reserve_configurations`
WHERE
  CURRENT_DATE() BETWEEN effective_from_date AND COALESCE(effective_to_date, '9999-12-31')
GROUP BY
  reserve_rate_bucket
ORDER BY
  MIN(reserve_rate)
```

### Correlating Reserves with Risk Indicators

```sql
SELECT
  r.merchant_id,
  r.reserve_rate,
  r.reserve_type,
  r.rolling_window_days,
  rm.risk_score,
  cb.chargeback_rate,
  gpv.monthly_gpv_usd
FROM
  `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__shopify_payments_reserve_configurations` r
LEFT JOIN (
  -- Join to risk metrics
  SELECT
    merchant_id,
    risk_score,
    snapshot_date
  FROM
    `sdp-prd-cti-data.merchant.risk_metrics`
  WHERE
    snapshot_date = DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
) rm ON r.merchant_id = rm.merchant_id
LEFT JOIN (
  -- Join to chargeback rates
  SELECT
    merchant_id,
    chargeback_count / NULLIF(transaction_count, 0) AS chargeback_rate
  FROM
    `sdp-prd-cti-data.merchant.chargeback_metrics`
  WHERE
    metric_date = DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
) cb ON r.merchant_id = cb.merchant_id
LEFT JOIN (
  -- Join to GPV
  SELECT
    merchant_id,
    SUM(amount_usd) AS monthly_gpv_usd
  FROM
    `sdp-prd-cti-data.finance.transactions`
  WHERE
    transaction_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  GROUP BY
    merchant_id
) gpv ON r.merchant_id = gpv.merchant_id
WHERE
  CURRENT_DATE() BETWEEN r.effective_from_date AND COALESCE(r.effective_to_date, '9999-12-31')
ORDER BY
  r.reserve_rate DESC
```

## Reserve Impact Analysis

```sql
WITH merchant_before_after AS (
  SELECT
    m.merchant_id,
    r.effective_from_date AS reserve_start_date,
    r.reserve_rate,
    r.reserve_type,
    
    -- Pre-reserve metrics (30 days before)
    (SELECT AVG(daily_gpv_usd)
     FROM `sdp-prd-cti-data.finance.merchant_daily_gpv`
     WHERE merchant_id = m.merchant_id
       AND gpv_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(r.effective_from_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY) 
                        AND DATE_SUB(r.effective_from_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    ) AS avg_daily_gpv_before,
    
    -- Post-reserve metrics (30 days after)
    (SELECT AVG(daily_gpv_usd)
     FROM `sdp-prd-cti-data.finance.merchant_daily_gpv`
     WHERE merchant_id = m.merchant_id
       AND gpv_date BETWEEN r.effective_from_date
                        AND DATE_ADD(r.effective_from_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    ) AS avg_daily_gpv_after
  FROM
    `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__shopify_payments_reserve_configurations` r
  JOIN
    `sdp-prd-cti-data.merchant.merchant_details` m
    ON r.merchant_id = m.merchant_id
  WHERE
    r.effective_from_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
    AND r.effective_from_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)  -- Ensure we have 30 days of post-data
    AND r.reserve_rate > 0  -- Only include merchants with actual reserves
)

SELECT
  merchant_id,
  reserve_start_date,
  reserve_rate,
  reserve_type,
  avg_daily_gpv_before,
  avg_daily_gpv_after,
  avg_daily_gpv_after - avg_daily_gpv_before AS absolute_gpv_change,
  SAFE_DIVIDE(avg_daily_gpv_after - avg_daily_gpv_before, avg_daily_gpv_before) AS percent_gpv_change
FROM
  merchant_before_after
WHERE
  avg_daily_gpv_before > 0  -- Avoid division by zero
ORDER BY
  percent_gpv_change
```

## Notes and Best Practices üìù

- Always use `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__shopify_payments_reserve_configurations` as the primary source for reserve data
- When analyzing reserve impact, consider a sufficient time window before and after changes
- Account for seasonality when measuring reserve impact on processing volumes
- Correlate reserve changes with risk indicators to assess effectiveness
- Consider both the reserve rate and minimum amount when analyzing merchant impact
- When setting up new reserves, use historical data to model potential impact on merchant cash flow

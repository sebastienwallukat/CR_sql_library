## Shop Risk Comparison with Industry Peers

This query compares a shop's risk metrics with peers in the same industry:

```sql
WITH shop_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    shop_detail.shop_id,
    shop_detail.shop_name,
    shop_detail.industry AS industry_category,
    shop_detail.shop_score AS risk_score
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.mart_core_operate.identity_account_shop_summary_current` s,
    UNNEST(s.shop_details) AS shop_detail
  WHERE
    shop_detail.shop_id = 12345
),

industry_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    shop_detail.industry AS industry_category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT shop_detail.shop_id) as shop_count,
    AVG(shop_detail.shop_score) as avg_risk_score,
    APPROX_QUANTILES(shop_detail.shop_score, 100)[OFFSET(75)] as p75_risk_score
  FROM

## Shop Activity Timeline

This query creates a comprehensive timeline of significant shop events:

```sql
WITH shop_tickets AS (
  SELECT
    subjectable_id as shop_id,
    created_at as event_date,
    CONCAT('ticket_', latest_report_type) as event_type,

  FROM
    `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_tickets_summary_v1`

    AND a.created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
),

shop_ticket_escalations AS (
  SELECT
    t.subjectable_id as shop_id,
    e.created_at as event_date,

  WHERE
    t.subjectable_id = 12345
    AND e.created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
),

all_events AS (
  SELECT * FROM shop_tickets
  UNION ALL SELECT * FROM shop_ticket_actions
  UNION ALL SELECT * FROM shop_ticket_escalations
)

SELECT
  event_date,
  event_type,
  event_description
FROM
  all_events
ORDER BY
  event_date DESC
```

## Notes and Best Practices üìù

- These queries have been validated to ensure they use existing tables and proper data types
- For TIMESTAMP fields, always use `TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL X DAY)` instead of `DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL X DAY)`
- For DATE fields, always use `DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL X DAY)`
- To use these queries for different shops, replace the shop_id value (currently set to 12345) with your target shop ID
- The key tables for shop analysis are:
  - `shopify-dw.mart_core_operate.identity_account_shop_summary_current` - Primary shop information
  - `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_tickets_summary_v1` - Ticket information
- Adjust date ranges based on the shop's age and processing history
- Always use the recommended tables for tickets (`shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_*`)

Feel free to contribute new full queries or improve the existing ones. Together, we can build a comprehensive resource for shop analysis.

Happy analyzing! üîé

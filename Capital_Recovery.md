## Recovery Methods Reference üìã

Common recovery methods include:

1. **Direct Refund Request** - Processing a refund through the merchant's payment processor
2. **Chargeback** - Issuing a chargeback through the customer's card issuer
3. **Merchant Direct Engagement** - Direct outreach to merchants for repayment
4. **Legal Action** - Formal legal proceedings for recovery
5. **Reserve Capture** - Using reserved funds to cover losses
6. **Debt Collection** - Engaging third-party collection agencies
7. **Payment Plan** - Establishing a structured repayment schedule with merchants

## Notes and Best Practices üìù

- Always prioritize recovery methods based on recovery rate and average time to recovery
- For small amounts (under $100), evaluate whether the recovery effort cost justifies the potential return
- Track recovery rate trends over time to identify process improvements or deterioration
- Consider industry norms when evaluating recovery performance
- Document all recovery attempts for compliance and audit purposes
- Review aging recovery cases regularly to ensure timely action
- Compare recovery rates against industry benchmarks

Happy recovering! üí∞

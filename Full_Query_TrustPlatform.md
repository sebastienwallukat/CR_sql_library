# Full Query - TrustPlatform üîç

Welcome to the TrustPlatform section of our SQL Query Resource Center. This page contains comprehensive end-to-end queries for analyzing the TrustPlatform system.

## Recommended Datasets

Always use these tables for Trust Platform analysis:
- `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_tickets_summary_v1` - Primary tickets table
- `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_actions_summary_v1` - Actions taken on tickets
- `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_ticket_escalations_v1` - Ticket escalation events

## Comprehensive Ticket Analysis

This query provides a complete analysis of tickets, actions, and escalations:

```sql
WITH ticket_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    t.shop_id,
    t.ticket_id,
    t.ticket_type,
    t.priority,
    t.status,
    t.created_at,
    t.updated_at,
    t.assignee,
    TIMESTAMP_DIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), t.created_at, HOUR) as hours_open,
    CASE
      WHEN t.status = 'closed' THEN TIMESTAMP_DIFF(t.updated_at, t.created_at, HOUR)
      ELSE NULL
    END as resolution_time_hours
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_tickets_summary_v1` t
  WHERE
    t.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
),

ticket_actions AS (
  SELECT
    a.ticket_id,
    COUNT(*) as action_count,
    ARRAY_AGG(a.action_type ORDER BY a.created_at) as actions_taken,
    MIN(a.created_at) as first_action_time,
    MAX(a.created_at) as last_action_time
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_actions_summary_v1` a
  JOIN
    ticket_metrics t ON a.ticket_id = t.ticket_id
  GROUP BY
    a.ticket_id
),

ticket_escalations AS (
  SELECT
    e.ticket_id,
    COUNT(*) as escalation_count,
    ARRAY_AGG(e.escalation_reason ORDER BY e.created_at) as escalation_reasons,
    MIN(e.created_at) as first_escalation_time
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_ticket_escalations_v1` e
  JOIN
    ticket_metrics t ON e.ticket_id = t.ticket_id
  GROUP BY
    e.ticket_id
)

SELECT
  t.*,
  a.action_count,
  a.actions_taken,
  a.first_action_time,
  a.last_action_time,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(a.first_action_time, t.created_at, MINUTE) as minutes_to_first_action,
  e.escalation_count,
  e.escalation_reasons,
  e.first_escalation_time,
  CASE
    WHEN e.first_escalation_time IS NOT NULL 
    THEN TIMESTAMP_DIFF(e.first_escalation_time, t.created_at, HOUR)
    ELSE NULL
  END as hours_to_escalation
FROM
  ticket_metrics t
LEFT JOIN
  ticket_actions a ON t.ticket_id = a.ticket_id
LEFT JOIN
  ticket_escalations e ON t.ticket_id = e.ticket_id
ORDER BY
  t.created_at DESC
```

## Ticket Performance by Assignee

```sql
WITH assignee_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    t.assignee,
    COUNT(*) as total_tickets,
    COUNTIF(t.status = 'closed') as closed_tickets,
    COUNTIF(t.status = 'open' OR t.status = 'in_progress') as open_tickets,
    AVG(CASE WHEN t.status = 'closed' THEN TIMESTAMP_DIFF(t.updated_at, t.created_at, HOUR) END) as avg_resolution_hours,
    APPROX_QUANTILES(CASE WHEN t.status = 'closed' THEN TIMESTAMP_DIFF(t.updated_at, t.created_at, HOUR) END, 2)[OFFSET(1)] as median_resolution_hours
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_tickets_summary_v1` t
  WHERE
    t.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    AND t.assignee IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY
    t.assignee
),

assignee_actions AS (
  SELECT
    t.assignee,
    COUNT(a.action_id) as total_actions,
    COUNT(a.action_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT t.ticket_id) as actions_per_ticket
  FROM
    `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_tickets_summary_v1` t
  JOIN
    `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_actions_summary_v1` a ON t.ticket_id = a.ticket_id
  WHERE
    t.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    AND t.assignee IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY
    t.assignee
)

SELECT
  m.assignee,
  m.total_tickets,
  m.closed_tickets,
  m.open_tickets,
  m.closed_tickets / m.total_tickets as ticket_close_rate,
  m.avg_resolution_hours,
  m.median_resolution_hours,
  a.total_actions,
  a.actions_per_ticket
FROM
  assignee_metrics m
JOIN
  assignee_actions a ON m.assignee = a.assignee
ORDER BY
  m.total_tickets DESC
```

## Rule Triggering Analysis

This query provides insights into which rules are generating tickets and their metadata:

```sql
SELECT 
  t.shop_id,
  t.ticket_id,
  t.ticket_type,
  t.priority,
  t.status,
  t.created_at AS ticket_created_at,
  a.action_type,
  a.created_at AS action_created_at,
  -- Analyze metadata from actions to understand rule context
  JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(a.metadata, '$.rule_identifier') AS rule_identifier,
  JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(a.metadata, '$.trigger_reason') AS trigger_reason,
  JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(a.metadata, '$.risk_score') AS risk_score
FROM 
  `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_tickets_summary_v1` AS t
JOIN 
  `shopify-dw.risk.trust_platform_actions_summary_v1` AS a
  ON t.ticket_id = a.ticket_id
WHERE
  t.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
  AND JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(a.metadata, '$.rule_identifier') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
  t.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100
```

## Notes and Best Practices üìù

- Always use the recommended TrustPlatform tables listed above
- These tables provide the most reliable and comprehensive data
- For large date ranges, consider adding more specific filters
- When analyzing assignee performance, account for ticket priority and complexity
- Use the ticket action history to understand workflow patterns
- When querying rule metadata, use the JSON extraction functions to parse the metadata fields

Feel free to contribute new full queries or improve the existing ones. Together, we can build a comprehensive resource for TrustPlatform analysis.

Happy analyzing! üîé

## Look into rules metadata
```
SELECT 
r.shop_id,
    r.detection_identifier as rule_name,
    r.report_group,
    r.report_type,
    t.ticket_id,
    t.status,
    t.created_at AS ticket_created_at,

    r.monitoring_metadata,-- << this will pull all the metadata at once so if you want it to be separated then

    json_extract_scalar(monitoring_metadata,'$.bad_reviews') AS name_of_metadata --<< this way, you can pull the data one by one, easier to read 
FROM 
  `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__sensitive_reports` AS r
  JOIN `sdp-prd-cti-data.base.base__tickets`  AS t
    ON r.report_id = t.reportable_id
WHERE
  DATE(t.created_at) >= date('2024-01-01')
  AND detection_identifier = 'Event::Shop10kTo50kThreshold'-- << you need to use the detection_identifier of the rule 
```

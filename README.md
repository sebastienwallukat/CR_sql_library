# Welcome to Our SQL Query Library! :books:

Hello there! :wave: Welcome to our cozy corner of SQL queries. This repository is more than just a collection of SQL queries we use regularly. It's our knowledge hub, our go-to guide, and our secret weapon for maintaining consistency in our data analysis. 

Think of this library as a bustling marketplace, where each stall is a different file dedicated to a specific data point. Each stallholder (file) offers a variety of goods (queries) aimed at calculating their specialty (data point). 

And for those who love a good treasure hunt, we have a couple of files dedicated to more complex, comprehensive queries. :mag:

## Our Stalls (Files) :file_folder:

1. [Chargeback](./Chargeback.md) - Your one-stop-shop for all things chargeback.
2. [Order](./Order.md) - Everything you need to know about orders.
3. [Shopify Payment Balance](./Shopify_Payment_Balance.md) - Balancing the books, Shopify style.
4. [Booked Losses](./Booked_Losses.md) - A necessary evil, let's make it easier.
5. [TrustPlatform Tickets](./TrustPlatform_Tickets.md) - Your ticket to understanding TrustPlatform.
6. [Others](./Others.md) - A mixed bag of useful queries.
7. [Full Query - Shop](./Full_Query_Shop.md) - The whole shebang for Shop data.
8. [Full Query - TrustPlatform](./Full_Query_TrustPlatform.md) - The full monty for TrustPlatform data.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to these files. This library is a living, breathing document. We encourage everyone to add new queries, refine existing ones, and share their knowledge. 

So, let's collaborate and make this a valuable resource for our team. :handshake:

Happy querying! :computer: :coffee:
